                The  64 began its design life in January of 1981 when MOS Technology engineers decided they needed a new chip project.
                MOS' Albert Charpentier had been responsible for several of the highly successful VIC-20 chips.
                “We were fresh out of ideas for whatever chips the rest of the world might want us to do.
                So we decided to produce a state-of-the-art video and sound chips for the worlds next great video game”.
        
                By November of 1981, the chips were completed but Commodore's president Jack Tramiel decided against using them in the faltering arcade game market.
                Instead he tasked the engineers with developing a 64 kilobyte home computer for show at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show (CES) the second week  of January 1982; just 6 weeks away.
                
                Two days after Jacks request, the basic design was completed and by the end of December 1981 the hardware for five VIC-30 (the C64's development name) prototypes were assembled.
                In the remaining two weeks, the VIC-20 operating system with lowly Commodore Basic 2.0 was stretched onto the C64.
                With an estimated retail price of just $595 ($1250 dollars in 2018), it was the buzz of the show.
                It did not hurt that there were no other new powerful computers shown at CES by Commodores competitors that year.
                The Commodore 64 was alive: it was immediately ordered into production which hit full stride by August 1982.
