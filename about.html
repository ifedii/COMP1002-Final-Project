                        This company was established in 1982, in which the company's founders took their unique passion and interest in their art of the understanding what the Commodore is about and what it entails. The founders brought their vision into reality and put all their knowledge first on paper, and on real-world applications. They have turned the fate of theoretical success, into a solid and witnesses success today.

                    <p>For years I have had one goal in mind, and that is to show glory to the lost treasures of technology and bring it back into the our current times. Commodores have always been an aspiration for me, how they are designed, how different configurations change the commodores functionality. I have experimented in testing countless times with these relics just enough to be able to run a full show of Commodores to be sold.</p>

                    <p>Ever since this company was formed, I have never felt more at home in this environment. There are tons of people with the same passion as me for something rather strange, which is the restoration of these 80s pieces of technology, and bringing it back into the limelight of the present and future. Over the years at this company, I have excelled in my expertise and made me want to learn and experiment more on the design and history of the Commodore.</p>

                    <p>before this company was founded I have been researching and testing various PC's and its capabilities. I can provide the necessary details of each and every Commodore on our shelves. In some way, I am what they call a specialist in my field of expertise. And I would like to put all that knowledge to practice in the sales of our company and make it more visible in popularity to the public.</p>
